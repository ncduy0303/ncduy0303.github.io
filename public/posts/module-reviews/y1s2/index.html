The workload was much higher than the first semester, but it was still manageable as I utilised all my freshman S/U.\nI took a total of 7 modules: 4 core modules (CS1231S, CS2030S, MA2001, MA1521), 2 common curriculum modules (DTK1234 and IS1108), and 1 RVRC module (RVX1000). I also took another CFG module CFG1004.\nTotal amount of MCs: 30\nCS1231S Discrete Structures Workload: Medium\nExpected Grade: A+\nActual Grade: A+\nAssessment:\n5% Tutorial Attendance 10% Assignment 1 10% Assignment 2 25% Midterm 50% Final This module introduced various discrete structures: propositional logic, predicate logic, set theory, relations, functions, graphs, etc.\nThe module was a foundational math module for computer science, and it was also the most abstract one compared to the other math modules I took (Calculus and Linear Algebra).\nThe most challenging topics for me were partial orders and cardinality as they were quite abstract and hard to visualise.\nThe bellcurve for my semester quite low (compared to semester I) where I got the highest score for all the components ðŸ˜….\nI would recommend this module to anyone who wants to learn more about the fundamenetals math concepts in computer science.\nCS2030S Programming Methodology II Workload: High\nExpected Grade: A+\nActual Grade: A+\nAssessment:\n5% Weekly Lecture Quizzes 30% 8 Lab Assignments 10% Practical Assessment 1 20% Practical Assessment 2 10% Midterm 25% Final This module introduced various programming concepts: object-oriented programming, generics, exceptions, streams, etc. It is a natural continuation of CS1101S.\nExcept for OOP, most of the concepts were new and required a lot of practice. It became more difficult as the semester progressed, and the workload was quite high.\nIt was fortunate that I had some prior experience with Java thanks to CS2040, so I was able to focus on learning the new concepts.\nThe practical assessments were quite challenging to complete within the time limit, so it is important to practice a lot before the actual assessment.\nI would recommend this module to anyone who wants to learn more about programming in general.\nMA2001 Linear Algebra I Workload: Medium\nExpected Grade: A\nActual Grade: A+\nAssessment:\n25% 4 Assignments 25% Midterm 50% Final This module introduced various linear algebra concepts: vector spaces, linear transformations, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, etc.\nIf you take H2 Further Math, you should be familiar with about 75% of the content. This module simply dive deeper into the topics in a more rigorous way, and some new topics would be orthogonal bases.\nSome of the proofs were quite challenging (especially under exam condition), but you can still do well if you can do most of the computational questions accurately during the exam. I could only solve 1 out of 2 proving questions during the final exam ðŸ¥².\nI would recommend this module to anyone who wants to learn more about linear algebra which has wide applications in various fields besides computer science.\nMA1521 Calculus for Computing Workload: Low\nExpected Grade: A\nActual Grade: A+\nAssessment:\n35% 5 Online Quizzes 65% Final This module introduced various calculus concepts: limits, differentiation, integration, etc.\nThe pace for this module is quite fast as it tried to cover a lot of topics, including multivariable calculus. However, there were no proofs, and all of the quiz/exam questions were computational.\nA good tip is to have a calculator that can do differentiation and integration (e.g. Casio fx-991EX) as it can help you check your answers quickly during the exam.\nI would recommend this module to anyone who wants to learn about calculus in a chill way. If you want to delve deeper, you should take MA2002 and MA2104.\nDTK1234 Design Thinking Workload: Low\nExpected Grade: B\nActual Grade: B\nAssessment:\n30% Individual Learning Activities (ILAs) 30% Team-based workshops (TBWs) 15% Interim Design Thinking Journal 25% Final Design Thinking Journal This module introduced various design thinking concepts: empathy, ideation, prototyping, etc.\nThe workload for this module is flexible as you can choose to do more or less depending on your interest. I did not invest much time in this module, and simply enjoyed the process of learning especially during the TBWs which were quite fun as there were many hands-on activities ðŸ˜‚.\nI would recommend this module to anyone in School of Computing who needs to fulfil the ID requirement.\nIS1108 Digital Ethics and Data Privacy Workload: Low\nExpected Grade: B+\nActual Grade: A-\nAssessment:\n10% Tutorial Attendance 20% Case Scenarios 1 \u0026 2 (Group work) 30% Group Project (10% presentation, 5% peer evaluation, 15% report) 30% Individual Quizzes 10% Individual Reflective Blogs This module introduced various ethical concepts related to technology.\nThe content was quite standard as what you would expect from an ethics module. The workload was quite low, and the quizzes were open book.\nI would recommend this module to anyone who wants to learn more about ethics in the context of technology.\nRVX1000 Citizen Speak: Persuasion and Polarization in Society Workload: Medium\nExpected Grade: B+\nActual Grade: A-\nAssessment:\n10% Class Participation 15% Collaborative Essay 25% 8-minute Pitch 40% Individual Critique Essay This module introduced various communicative resources that are related to issues pertaining to sustainability, inclusion and exclusion, and public participation in various contexts.\nThis is quite a theoretical module where we learnt about different communication theories and apply them to real-life examples especially in the context of public discourse.\nThe readings were quite difficult to understand, but the lecturer was quite helpful in explaining the concepts.\nI would recommend this module to anyone who wants to learn more about communication in the context of public discourse.\n","wordCount":"941","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://ncduy.github.io/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2023-06-25T17:04:32+08:00","dateModified":"2023-06-25T17:04:32+08:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://ncduy.github.io/posts/module-reviews/y1s2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Duy Nguyen","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ncduy.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://ncduy.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Duy Nguyen (Alt + H)"><img src=https://ncduy.github.io/images/profile.jpg alt aria-label=logo height=35>Duy Nguyen</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
