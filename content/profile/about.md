## Introduction

---

Hello world 👋🏼, my name is **Duy** (try to say "yu-uy" in one sound) and I am from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I have been studying in Singapore since late 2017 when I was 15 years old. I am currently a first-year undergraduate student at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

In my free time, I enjoy reading manga 📖, watching football ⚽️, or simply visiting new places 🧭. I also love to learn new things 🔍 and I am always open to new experiences 🌎. My favorite subjects are Mathematics 🧮 and Computer Science 💻 where I can apply theoretical knowledge to solve real-world problems.
